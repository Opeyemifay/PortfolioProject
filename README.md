This project is mainly for COVID19 Data Exploration.
Skills Used: Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data types.
It explores the following:
Total Cases  vs Total Deaths (Shows the likelihood of dying, if you contract covid in Nigeria).
Total cases vs Population (Shows what percentage of population is infected with Covid in Nigeria).
Countries with highest infection rate compared to population.
Countries With Highest Death Count per Population.
By Continent (Showing Continents with Highest Death Count per Population).
Total Populations vs Total Vaccines (Shows Percentage of Population that have received at least one Covid Vaccine).
Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
Creating View to store data for later visualizations
